Cancellation Policy: Ownerless Business CRM

1. Introduction

We understand that business needs can change, and we strive to make the cancellation process straightforward and fair. This policy outlines the terms and conditions for canceling your subscription to the Ownerless Business CRM.

2. Cancellation Process

To cancel your subscription, please follow these steps:

Submit a Request: Send a cancellation request via email to contact@ownerlessbusiness.com or through your account dashboard if available.
Confirmation: You will receive a confirmation email acknowledging your cancellation request.
3. Cancellation Timing

Monthly Subscriptions: Cancellation requests must be submitted at least 5 business days before the end of the current billing cycle to avoid charges for the following month. If the request is submitted after this period, you will be billed for the next month, and the cancellation will take effect at the end of that billing cycle.
Annual Subscriptions: Cancellation requests must be submitted at least 15 business days before the renewal date of your annual subscription. If the request is made after this period, the cancellation will take effect at the end of the current subscription year, and no refund will be provided for the remaining months.
4. Refunds

Monthly Subscriptions: No refunds are issued for partial months. If you cancel within the first 14 days of a new billing cycle, you may be eligible for a refund for that cycle.
Annual Subscriptions: No refunds are provided for unused months remaining in the annual subscription period after cancellation.
5. Account Access

Upon cancellation, you will retain access to your CRM account until the end of the current billing cycle. After this period, access to the CRM and all associated data will be terminated.

6. Data Retention

Data Export: We recommend exporting any necessary data before canceling your subscription. Data export tools may be available in your account settings.
Data Deletion: Upon cancellation, we will retain your data for a period of 30 days in case you wish to reactivate your account. After 30 days, all data associated with your account will be permanently deleted.
7. Reinstatement

If you decide to reactivate your subscription within 30 days of cancellation, you can do so by contacting our support team. Reinstatement will be subject to the current pricing and plan availability.
